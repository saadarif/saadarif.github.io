## Abstract

We present a genome assembly from an individual male Aporia crataegi (the black-veined white; Arthropoda; Insecta; Lepidoptera; Pieridae). The genome sequence is 230 megabases in span. The complete assembly is scaffolded into 26 chromosomal pseudomolecules, with the Z sex chromosome assembled. Gene annotation of this assembly on Ensembl has identified 10,860 protein coding genes.
