:::{#person-profile}
:::

I am a senior lecturer at the [Department of Biological and Medical Science](https://www.brookes.ac.uk/bms) at the [Oxford Brookes University](https://www.brookes.ac.uk/). I am also associated with [Centre for Functional Genomics](https://www.brookes.ac.uk/research/units/hls/centres/centre-for-functional-genomics#) at Brookes, serving as its first scientific director from 2019-2021. I received a PhD in Genetics from Oxford Brookes University in 2013. 

I am an evolutionary biologist studying the genetics and genomics of ecology, evolution, development and conservation. I received an [Alexander von Humboldt Post-doctoral research fellowship](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/bewerben/foerderprogramme/humboldt-forschungsstipendium) in 2014. I use genomic and genetic tools to research the biology and conservation of invertebrates (mostly ðŸ¦‹ these days).

I teach courses at various levels including undergraduate and postgraduate. My teaching includes data science, statistical inference, bioinformatics and reproducibility (particularly literate programming and version control/colloboration) in biology and the environmental sciences - concepts and approaches that are crucial to my own research. I also teach courses on reproducibility and programming and data science in R aimed at researchers.
