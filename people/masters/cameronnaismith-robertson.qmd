:::{#person-profile}

Cameron is a master’s student currently undertaking the integrated MBIOL degree in Biological Sciences at Oxford Brookes University. He has a previous background in control systems engineering but transitioned into biology to pursue his long-standing passion for the life sciences. His academic interests span genetics, genomics, evolution, and developmental biology, with a particular focus on computational techniques and applying these disciplines to modern challenges. For his master’s research project, Cameron is working on a metagenomics study of museum arthropod specimens (primarily butterflies) to investigate contamination signatures in sequencing data and age-related DNA degradation patterns.
