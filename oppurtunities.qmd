## For Undergraduate Students

I routinely advertise undergraduate research projects, for Oxford Brookes Students. These will be advertise to 2nd year Biological Sciences (all themes) students through the Career Development module in December. If you are super keen on genomics, biodiversity and bioinformatics, you can contact me earlier.

## For Master's students

I am keen on supervising Master's students interested in genomics, biodiversity and bioinformatics. There are various routes to doing a Master's project with me if you want to do or currently are on a postgraduate degree at Oxford Brookes, including: MRes, MBiol and MSc programmes in Medical Genetics and Genomics and Conservation Biology.

## For PhD Students

I welcome interest of applications from students with [research](research.qmd) interests similar to my own. I may have project available but I am happy to supervise other projects that are within my area of interest or expertise. I do expect PhD students to be passionate about their projects and be able to work independently in the lab, in the field and in the computer (after some prior training of course). I like to think of my PhD student as junior colloborators rather than students.

There are two main routes to apply to do a PhD with me. Every few years I advertise fully-funded PhD projects supported by Nigel Groome Studentships from Department of Biological and Medical Sciences at Oxford Brookes. These will be advertised here and elsewhere when available. These are usually adverstised by December and application deadlines are in January or February.

Students interested in doing a PhD with me can also look into the [BBSRC DTP programme](https://www.biodtp.ox.ac.uk/oxford-brookes-university-studentships). There are two studentships available for this DTP via Oxford Brookes every year. This is a highly competitive and excellent PhD training programme. You can choose to do your PhD project with me or with any of the other Brookes faculty that are part of this programme. if you are potentially interested in working with me *via* this route, please contact me. Deadline for applications are usually in January.
