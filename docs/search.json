    "text": "I am a senior lecturer at the Department of Biological and Medical Science at the Oxford Brookes University. I am also associated with Centre for Functional Genomics at Brookes, serving as its first scientific director from 2019-2021. I received a PhD in Genetics from Oxford Brookes University in 2013.\nI am an evolutionary biologist studying the genetics and genomics of ecology, evolution, development and conservation. I received an Alexander von Humboldt Post-doctoral research fellowship in 2014. I use genomic and genetic tools to research the biology and conservation of invertebrates (mostly ðŸ¦‹ these days).\nI teach courses at various levels including undergraduate and postgraduate. My teaching includes data science, statistical inference, bioinformatics and reproducibility in biology and the environmental sciences - concepts and approaches that are crucial to my own research. I also teach courses on reproducibility and programming and data science in R aimed at researchers."
