## Scope of Our Research

We work on and welcome research in all areas of invertebrate biology including ecology, evolution, morphology and conservation. Research in the lab is primarily curiosity-driven and usually best described as [basic research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_research). However, some of our work particularly in the area of conservation genomics, hopes to give something back to the organisms we work with, by evaluating  and appraising the application of genomic research in conservation. 

Methodologically, we use genomic data, particularly [population genomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genomics#:~:text=Population%20genomics%20is%20a%20neologism,and%20demography%20of%20a%20population.) and [functional genomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_genomics) approaches. However, where relevant I also use genome-editing and collaborate with ecologists and developmental biologists that work with various different tools and organisms (including vertebrates and occaisionally plants).

## Current Projects

Current projects in the lab focus around the biology of UK butterflies. Currently, there are two main strands to this research:

- **Extinction and Conservation Genomics** - We use genomic data from museum samples of extirpated UK butterflies. We are interested in understanding if genomic data can reveal something about the regional extinction of these species. We complement our analysis of extirpated species, with the analyses of currently declining or stable/expanding species. All these species should share a similar demographic history over the last 10K years, but other, including ecological and life history traits, have influenced their fate after the colonisation of the British Isles. Large scale population genomic comparisons, of extirpated, declining and stable (or expanding) species should help shed some light on the factors influencing insect genetic diversity within the British Isles. Additionally, this work helps evaluate [genomic erosion](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2022.960958/full) in species with differing ecology and population sizes, helping us understand how to make sense of conservation genomics for insects.   

- **Reproductive manipulation by *Wolbachia*** - Our work on the [population genomics of *Polyommatus icarus*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.16126) revealed patterns of *Wolbachia* (an obligate bacterial endosymbiont common in arthropods) infection which may be suggestive of reproductive manipulation. Current work on this project is involved in determining exactly which mode (if any) of *Wolbachia*-mediated reproductive manipulation may be at play in *P. icarus* populations of northern Scotland or the western Isles. Understanding the modes and mechanisms of reproductive manipulation by endosymbionts has applications for biocontrol of arthropod species classified as "pests".
